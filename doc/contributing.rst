TODO

Key points:

 - The master branch should always be stable and ready to release

 - A separate branch is created for each release

 - Development occurs through a pull request (a.k.a. "merge request") model. All
   changes to the master branch occur via merge requests.

 - Use semantic versioning, to allow for compatibilty testing:
   http://semver.org/

 - Unit tests are currently run with `py.test` and `coverage`. Aim for 100%
   code coverage.
